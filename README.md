## CAUTION

This automated script was created for a **specific machine**, with **specific hardware**, and was tested **only on Arch Linux**.
If you already have dotfiles and want to test it, **make sure to back them up first**.

## MacOS Keyboard on Linux

- This script includes a configuration to make a Linux keyboard behave like **macOS (not ISO or US layout)**.  
  However, it’s **not finished yet** — accents still need fixes, and `Home` / `End` work only partially.
- I’m confident it works on **Arch Linux + Hyprland**, but I haven’t tested it on other window managers or desktop environments.
- The keyboard remapper was made for **ABNT2**, but modifying the **Kanata** script is fairly easy.
- You’ll probably enjoy the **terminal settings** and the **Zed keymap**, since everything was designed specifically for **macOS users like me**.
- It’s not perfect, but I struggled a lot to find a good solution, and this was the best I could come up with.

### Why is this public?

Because it allows me to pull my repository, nothing more than that.  
But if this helps you in any way, I’m happy to have contributed.
